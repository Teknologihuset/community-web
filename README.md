# CommunityWeb

A community booking-webapp that will be made available for the Norwegian communities. The app will make it possible to book the meetup rooms at Rebel Teknologihuset.

### Initial plan / architecture

CommunityWeb will use [EntraOs.js](https://github.com/Teknologihuset/entraos-js) (_work in progress_) to fetch data from the Rebel API's.

CommunityWeb will be released in multiple stages, the first having only the ability to search and query availability of the Meetup-rooms.

### Get in touch with the team

CommunityWeb and all Teknologihuset-apps are made by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Get in touch with us through our open [Slack](javabin.slack.com) workspace.
